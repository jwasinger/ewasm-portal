        <description>
          
          Similar to object-oriented programming in Solidity - a contract-oriented language - the inheritance and polymorphism features are as widely adopted and critical for the language evolution. There is hardly any Solidity developer who hasn‚Äôt used these language features in their contracts to decouple logic and increase code reuse. With version...
