Types with mappings in memory are disallowed and shift and exponentiation operations use more reasonable types. Since we usually do not backport...

        This is a small bugfix release that solves an issue with certain tuple assignments. Important Bugfixes: Fix tuple assignments with components occupying multiple stack slots and different stack size on left- and right-hand-side. Bugfixes: AST export: Export immutable property in the field mutability. SMTChecker: Fix internal error in the CHC engine when calling inherited functions internally. Type Checker: Error when trying to encode functions with call options gas and value set. A big thank you to all contributors who helped...

        Version 0.6.5 of Solidity fixes an important bug and introduces immutable as a major feature. The bug concerns the allocation of dynamic memory arrays using e.g. new uint[](...). The bug is considered to have a severity level of “low” but is present in all prior versions of Solidity. Therefore, please read more about how check if your contract is vulnerable in this blog post. The immutable feature supports setting contract-level variables at construction time if they do not change later...

        This maintenance release of the 0.5.x series fixes a bug that was always present in the compiler. Some people do not even consider it a bug, though, which might explain why it was undiscovered for so long: A private function can be overridden in a derived contract by a private function of the same name and types. In other words, the virtual function calling mechanism does not respect visibility. The same applies to two private functions of the same name...

We took this opportunity and also extended the use of these function call options to specifying the gas and value options in external function calls: c.f{value: 10, gas: 20000}(arg1, arg2). Furthermore, interfaces can now inherit from interfaces, making them even more useful for specification purposes....

        This release includes some usability and security improvements and a further evolution of the SMT component. The var keyword has been deprecated for security reasons. Significant steps were made in writing optimisation stages for the intermediate language, which will be used by the new ABI encoder to produce highly optimised output. The main goal is to have a resulting bytecode size similar to the old ABI encoder, while having more runtime checks for a stricter decoding process. This is not...

        In the last weeks, we have mainly been working on big internal changes. One of them is the new ABI decoder, which is still in experimental mode, but will hopefully be production-usable soon. External contributions like allowing constant variables for array lengths and improved error messages should make your life as a programmer easier. Finally, the standard-json-io-system now allows to select certain artifacts from a contract which should speed up your code-compile-test-cycle even more!

        As we are getting closer to the next breaking release, we want to give everyone a heads up by introducing pragma experimental &quot;v0.5.0&quot; which already enables some of the new safety features of the 0.5.0 release. Furthermore, this release finally checks the modifiers view (used to be named constant) and pure on functions. As a rule of thumb, use view if your function does not modify storage and pure if it does not even read any state information - but...

        This Solidity release adds function types. Use-cases include supplying callbacks for asynchronous or off-chain operations or generic library features (for example map-reduce-style programming). This release also improves the safety of enums and sending Ether to a contract constructor. Features: Function types Do-while loops: support for a do &amp;lt;block&amp;gt; while (&amp;lt;expr&amp;gt;); control structure Inline assembly: support invalidJumpLabel as a jump label.

        This is a bugfix release that fixes a storage corruption that appears when multiple variables are stored in the same slot (details).

Bugfixes:

  Type checker: forbid signed exponential that led to an incorrect use of EXP opcode.
  Code generator: properly clean higher order bytes before storing in storage.

BREAKING CHANGES: You should not rely on division for literals resulting in a (truncated) integer. This is still the case but will change once we implement fixed point types, i.e. in the future 1/2 == 0.5 will be true, currently we have 1/2 == 0.
